# PlanMyTrip Challenge
Data bootcamp - week 6 challenge - APIs

## Project Overview
By following instructions in the homework, we created a travel planning app ("PlanMyTrip) that gathered information about cities around the world, including their country, geographical coordinates, and current weather (maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed). This information was then plotted on Google maps. Input was gathered about the user's preferred temperature range for a vacation destination, and then, with this narrower range of locations, hotel information for cities within that temperature range was gathered and mapped.

For this challenge, new features were added, including:
* A current description of weather conditions
* The ability to find and map a travel route between manually selected locations
* The ability to generate a map of selected locations, with hotel information

## Project Components
This challenge consisted of three deliverables.

*1. Weather data* for 2,000 randomly generated pairs of latitudes and longitudes (using numpy.random.uniform) that were matched to the nearest city (using citipy). Using the OpenWeatherMap API, current weather conditions for as many cities as possible were gathered and stored first in a Pandas DataFrame and then in a .csv file.

*2. Possible Travel Destinations Map* was generated by getting user input on desired temperature range, using that range to filter the weather data from deliverable 1 to a list of preferred cities, using the Google Places API to search for a hotel in each of those cities, plotting the preferred cities on a Google map, and creating pop-up boxes for each marked city, with hotel name, city, country, and current weather description, as shown below.

*3. Travel Itinerary Maps* were created by using the Google Directions API to show the driving route between four cities in Brazil that were manually selected from the possible travel destinations map created for deliverable 2. Hotel information for these four cities was also mapped as a separate layer.
